- Symbols
Greatly improves the strength of the password making it harder to crack.

Best practices and tips learned from evaluation:
1. Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
2. Make passwords at least 12 characters long and avoid common words or patterns.
3. Use unique passwords for different accounts and enable a password manager if needed.

Higher password complexity makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack passwords using brute-force or dictionary attacks, increasing overall security.
